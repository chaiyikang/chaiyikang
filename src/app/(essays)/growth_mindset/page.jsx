							…the tortoise would have never won,

						<Paragraph>
							What was the moral of the story of the
							tortoise and the hare? If we had
							considered the blunder of the hare, we may
							have learnt that we should never be
							complacent. On the other hand, the
							tortoise’s determination engendered the
							proverbial “slow and steady wins the
							race”. Yet, if we consider the story from
							a different angle, we can gain some
							insight about what I consider to be the
							most crucial concept in self-improvement —
							the growth mindset.
						</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>
							The tortoise never should have been able
							to win the race. What made his win
							possible? While the hare only lost because
							he was complacent, the tortoise only won
							because he did not stop. If he had stopped
							and given up after the hare got so far
							ahead he was out of sight, the tortoise
							would have never won, despite the hare’s
							complacency.
						</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>
							So why didn’t the tortoise stop? Did he
							genuinely believe that he could win? He
							couldn’t have been sure that the hare
							would stop and fall asleep, or that the
							hare would sleep long enough for the
							tortoise to win. I believe that to the
							tortoise, it was never a race. I think the
							reason the tortoise did not stop was
							because he wanted to prove that no matter
							how much slower than the hare he was, as
							long as he kept going, he too, could reach
							the finish line, just like the hare.

							Becoming unstoppable is the secret

							An unstoppable object moving towards a
							destination will always reach the
							destination, no matter how mind-numbingly,
							excruciatingly slow it is moving.

						<Paragraph>
							If it was never about a race or a
							competition to the tortoise, we should
							also stop reflecting on the story as if it
							were a race. What the tortoise really
							wanted to teach us was that no matter how
							slow your progress, as long as you don’t
							stop, you will eventually get there. This
							idea applies especially well to areas of
							personal growth, or really any area of
							growth where it really isn’t a race. If
							you’ve been trying to develop a growth
							mindset, this secret ingredient is perhaps
							the last piece of the puzzle.
						</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>
							People with a fixed mindset believe that
							their abilities are set from birth and are
							immutable. For instance, one would say,
							“I’m just so bad at math, I can’t help
							it!” On the other hand, people with a
							growth mindset believe that their inborn
							abilities are just a starting point, with
							a capacity for growth resulting from their
							own actions. For instance, one would
							instead say, “I’m bad at math, I really
							need to practice more.”
						</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>
							However, sometimes simply believing that
							we have a capacity for growth can be
							discouraging. If you wanted to increase
							the temperature of an ice cube, and you
							monitored its progress by looking at the
							reading on a thermometer, you might be
							disappointed that its temperature remains
							at 0°C (32°F) for a long time. That’s
							because when ice heats up, energy is being
							used to turn the ice into water — only
							after all the ice has melted into water
							will the temperature start increasing. So,
							if you keep staring at the thermometer, it
							certainly would seem that no progress is
							being made towards increasing the
							temperature. In reality, the ice is
							certainly melting, and you are certainly
							making progress towards increasing its
							temperature — the thermometer just can’t
							reflect that progress yet. Likewise, if
							you’re trying to lose weight, eating
							healthier for just a week won’t change the
							reading on the scale. If you’re trying to
							get stronger, doing pushups today probably
							won’t increase the number you can do
							tomorrow.
						</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>
							An unstoppable object moving towards a
							destination will always reach the
							destination, no matter how mind-numbingly,
							excruciatingly slow it is moving. Keep
							eating healthier and doing pushups for a
							month, and you might just lose a few
							pounds and double your reps. But in order
							to get there, for your ice cube to finish
							melting, you must be like the tortoise —
							unstoppable.

						<Paragraph>
							Perhaps The Tortoise and The Hare really
							should have been “The Tortoise and The
							Other Tortoise Who Ran Too Fast, Got Tired
							Then Gave Up”. We’ve discussed how being
							unstoppable is key. However, true
							unstoppability is only possible with
							moderation. We don’t know if it was
							possible for the tortoise to go any faster
							than he did, but we do know that he went
							at a pace that allowed him to be
							unstoppable. It is much better to go at a
							sustainable pace long-term than to go too
							fast and get burnt-out in the short term.
							For instance, if you go from eating fast
							food for all three meals to eating
							chicken, broccoli and rice for all three
							meals, you likely wouldn’t have lost as
							much weight after six months compared to
							if you had just replaced one meal. While
							replacing all three meals is objectively
							more effective in helping you lose weight,
							it isn’t practical. You would have likely
							relapsed back to your old diet many times,
							or even completely given up along the way.
							Making incremental, but bearable
							adjustments until you eventually replaced
							all three meals would have been a much
							better strategy. Small, progressive
							changes are good enough, because so long
							as you are unstoppable, you will still
							reach your goals.
						</Paragraph>
						<Quote>
							This echoes the Japanese concept of
							Kaizen, the philosophy of continuous
							improvement and the belief that small,
							incremental improvements can lead to huge
							impacts over time.
						</Quote>
						<Paragraph>
							On my 20th birthday, I resolved to start
							calisthenics as a means to become and look
							stronger. I tracked my progress for the
							various exercises that I did, and one of
							which were pull-ups. When I first started,
							I could do a maximum of 5 pullups in one
							go. After 23 days, I could do 7 reps,
							which was a modest, but encouraging
							improvement. By Day 39, I could do 8 reps.
							Take a guess how many more days it took to
							improve by 1 more rep.
						</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>
							It took a mind-numbing 221 more days,
							until I finally managed to squeeze out
							that 9th rep on Day 260. For the amount of
							effort exerted over those 221 days, it
							felt unfair and frustrating that my
							progress was so glacial. But I think, at
							some point, I realized that it didn’t
							really matter that I wasn’t seeing
							results. So long as I was still training
							properly, I just kept believing that my
							ice cube was still melting.
						</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>
							I’m proud of the fact that I never
							stopped. If I had stopped, I would have
							ceded to the fixed mindset and started
							believing that my body is simply incapable
							of doing more than 8 pullups. And I would
							have been kind of right, because indeed, I
							would never have been able to do more than
							8, for as long as I believed that it was
							true.
						</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>
							In essence, don’t judge yourself if your
							progress is slow or even unnoticeable.
							When it comes to areas of personal growth,
							it should never be a race. And if it is
							not a race, who cares if you’re going
							slow? The only thing that matters is being
							unstoppable — so unstoppable that you keep
							going even if you don’t see progress for
							220 days.
						</Paragraph>
						<Heading>Conclusion</Heading>
						<Paragraph>
							The tortoise teaches us:
						</Paragraph>
						<ol>
							<li>
								1. Be unstoppable. So long as you are
								unstoppable, you will certainly reach
								your goal.
							</li>
							<li>
								2. The growth mindset isn’t easy. Your
								progress may be slow, or even
								unnoticeable — which is the true test
								of a growth mindset. But if you can
								maintain unstoppability, it makes your
								growth mindset incredibly powerful.
							</li>
							<li>
								3. Is it really a race? We’ve been
								able to uncover these lessons by
								considering that The Tortoise and The
								Hare was never a race. Likewise, if we
								recognise that areas of personal
								growth aren’t a race, it becomes much
								easier to be unstoppable, no matter
								how slow we are going or how much
								faster other people are.{" "}
							</li>
						</ol>
						<Paragraph>
							It would be nice to be able to run as fast
							as the Hare. But as life would have it,
							most of the time, we can only go as fast
							as the Tortoise. But that’s okay. So long
							as we don’t stop, we’ll get there.
